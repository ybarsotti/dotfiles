# AI-Assisted TDD Workflow Visualization

A comprehensive visual guide to the Test-Driven Development workflow powered by Claude Code commands.

## Overview

This workflow represents a complete software development cycle from problem discovery through design, implementation, review, and shipping. Each phase is supported by dedicated Claude Code commands that ensure quality, performance, and best practices at every step.

**Key Principles**:
- **Design First**: Understand the problem before coding
- **TDD Always**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all implementations
- **Review Early**: Catch issues before they become problems
- **Ship Confidently**: Comprehensive checks before deployment

---

## Complete Workflow

The following D2 diagram shows the entire workflow from Discovery to Ship.

**Diagram Source**: The diagram is stored in `ai-workflow.d2` in the same directory.

### Visual Workflow Diagram

The workflow consists of 4 main phases:

1. **Design Phase** (Blue) - Problem analysis and solution design
   - User describes problem
   - `/design-solution` creates comprehensive design
   - `/review-solution-design` validates the design

2. **Develop Phase** (Purple) - TDD implementation
   - `/develop-solution` guides through Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Tests written first, then implementation, then refactoring

3. **Review Phase** (Light Blue) - Multi-layered code review
   - Automated review with `/review-solution-code`
   - Manual self-review
   - Split strategy for complex changes
   - Peer review with `/review-pr`

4. **Ship Phase** (Green) - Final validation and deployment
   - `/ship-it` runs all checks and creates PR

## Workflow Tips & Best Practices

### Design Phase Tips
- **Be thorough**: Don't rush the design phase
- **Search first**: Always look for existing code to leverage
- **Think performance**: Plan for N+1 prevention and caching upfront
- **Consider scale**: How will this work with 1M records?
- **Plan for failure**: What could go wrong?

### Development Phase Tips
- **Tests first, always**: Never write production code without a failing test
- **One test at a time**: Don't try to test everything at once
- **Keep tests simple**: Each test should verify one behavior
- **Test performance**: Include query count and response time tests
- **Commit often**: Small, focused commits in TDD cycle

### Review Phase Tips
- **Review your own code first**: Catch obvious issues before others see them
- **Use automated reviews**: `/review-solution-code` catches many issues
- **Break down large changes**: Use Split strategy for complex features
- **Respond promptly**: Address peer review feedback quickly
- **Learn from feedback**: Each review is a learning opportunity

### Ship Phase Tips
- **Run all checks**: Don't skip formatters, linters, or tests
- **Write meaningful PRs**: Help reviewers understand your changes
- **Include context**: Link to design docs and review findings
- **Test locally first**: Don't rely on CI to catch obvious issues
- **Celebrate**: Shipping is a big deal! üéâ

### General Tips
- **Iterate**: Don't try to do everything in one PR
- **Communicate**: Keep stakeholders informed of progress
- **Document decisions**: Use DESIGN.md and IMPLEMENTATION.md
- **Learn and improve**: Each cycle makes you better
- **Trust the process**: The workflow exists for good reasons

## Performance Optimization Focus

Throughout the entire workflow, there's a strong focus on performance:

### Design Phase
- Identify N+1 query risks
- Plan caching strategy
- Design for bulk operations
- Consider algorithmic complexity

### Development Phase
- Write performance tests (query counts, response times)
- Implement N+1 prevention
- Use bulk operations
- Add caching where appropriate

### Review Phase
- Check for N+1 queries
- Verify bulk operations are used
- Validate caching implementation
- Analyze algorithmic complexity

### Ship Phase
- Run performance benchmarks
- Verify query counts in tests
- Check response times meet targets

**Key Principle**: Performance is not an afterthought‚Äîit's built into every phase of the workflow.

## Troubleshooting

### Design Phase Issues
**Problem**: Design is too vague
- **Solution**: Use `/design-solution` to explore codebase more thoroughly
- Ask more specific questions about requirements

**Problem**: Design review finds major issues
- **Solution**: Iterate on design before moving to development
- Better to catch issues early than during implementation

### Development Phase Issues
**Problem**: Tests are failing
- **Solution**: That's expected in RED phase!
- Make sure tests are correct before implementing

**Problem**: Can't get tests to pass
- **Solution**: Review design document
- Simplify approach
- Ask for help if stuck

### Review Phase Issues
**Problem**: Too many issues found
- **Solution**: Fix issues iteratively
- Consider if design needs revisiting
- Learn patterns to avoid in future

**Problem**: Peer review taking too long
- **Solution**: Break PR into smaller pieces
- Provide better PR description
- Schedule dedicated review time

### Ship Phase Issues
**Problem**: CI/CD failing
- **Solution**: Run all checks locally first using `/ship-it`
- Fix issues before pushing

**Problem**: PR description unclear
- **Solution**: Use `/ship-it` which creates meaningful descriptions
- Include context from design and review docs

# Manually explore codebase and technologies

# 2. Document findings
# Create temporary docs/spike.md

# 3. Present findings
# Share with team

# 4. If approved, start full workflow
/design-solution  # Now you know more
```

### Refactoring Workflow
```bash
# 1. Design refactoring
/design-solution  # Describe what needs refactoring

# 2. Write tests for existing behavior first!
/develop-solution  # Tests should pass before refactoring

# Keep tests green while refactoring

# 4. Review and ship
/review-solution-code
/ship-it
```
