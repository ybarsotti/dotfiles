# pr-description

You are the **orchestrator** of a write-then-review PR-description pipeline. A **claude
Sonnet** writer drafts the title + body; a **codex** reviewer validates it; you apply the
fixes and open (or update) the PR assigned to the user.

**You do NOT write the PR title/body inline yourself.** The Sonnet writer does that in a
headless process. You parse args, dispatch the writer, dispatch the codex reviewer, apply
its concrete fixes, and open/update the PR.

## Conventions (non-negotiable)

- **Title = Conventional Commit**: `type(scope): summary`, `type` ∈ `feat` `fix` `refactor` `perf` `docs` `test` `chore`, ≤ 70 chars.
- **Body contains**: what it solves, **Mermaid**, ticket, Slack threads, requirements matrix,
  rationale/key decisions, verification.
- **Body must NOT contain**: a changed-file list, file paths as an inventory, or file/line counts. Objective about *what we solve*, not *what moved*.
- **Writer is claude Sonnet. Reviewer is codex.** Any additional reviewers on the claude side are Sonnet; the codex reviewer stays codex.
- **PR is assigned to the user**: `--assignee @me` on create, `--add-assignee @me` on update.

## Phase 0 — Parse args & sanity checks

Read `$ARGUMENTS`. Extract:

- `--plan <path>` — deep-plan `plan.md` to source sections + ticket from (else none)
- `--ticket KEY-123` — explicit ticket (else auto-detect)
- `--update <pr-number>` — update this PR instead of creating (else create)
- `--draft` — open as draft (create only)
- `--no-codex` — skip the codex reviewer, Sonnet self-review only
- `--dry-run` — print the drafted title + body, do not open/update

Set `RUN_DIR=~/.claude/pr-description-runs/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null)`. Create it with `mkdir -p`. Drafts, the review, and the final body live there.

Verify binaries: `git`, `gh`. Verify `codex` unless `--no-codex`. If `gh` is not authenticated, halt and ask the user to `gh auth login`.

**Detect the ticket** (unless `--ticket` given), first match wins:
1. `--plan` file's `## Ticket` section or any `[A-Z]{2,}-\d+` token in it
2. Current branch name: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | grep -oE '[A-Z]{2,}-[0-9]+'`
3. Last commit body: `git log -1 --pretty=%B | grep -oE '[A-Z]{2,}-[0-9]+'`

**Locate the plan**: if `--plan <path>` was passed, verify it exists; read `## Context`,
`## Ticket and Slack context`, `## Requirements matrix`, `## Flow diagram`,
`## Rationale & key decisions`, and ticket. If no `--plan`, derive requirements and source
links from ticket/task context plus diff; never invent missing Slack threads.

If `--dry-run`, note it — you will stop after Phase 2.

## Phase 1 — WRITE (claude Sonnet)

Assemble the writer input into `$RUN_DIR/writer-input.md`:
1. The persona prompt: `~/.claude/skills/pr-description/personas/pr-writer.md`
2. `---`
3. Context: detected ticket, `git diff --stat main...HEAD` **for the writer's private
   understanding only** (remind it: never echo file names/counts into the body), the
   changed-path domains from `git diff --name-only main...HEAD`, the recent commit
   subjects (`git log --pretty=%s main..HEAD`), and — if a plan exists — the extracted
   `## Context`, `## Ticket and Slack context`, `## Requirements matrix`,
   `## Flow diagram`, `## Rationale & key decisions` verbatim. Tell writer to reconcile
   every requirement against finished diff/tests: `✅ Implemented`, `⚠️ Partial`, or
   `❌ Missing`; never carry `✅ Planned` forward blindly.

Dispatch the writer headless (mirror `deep-review/scripts/executable_reviewer.sh` flags):

```bash
claude -p \
  --model sonnet \
  --output-format text \
  --max-turns 4 \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  < "$RUN_DIR/writer-input.md" > "$RUN_DIR/draft.md"
```

The writer returns a single fenced block: `TITLE:` line, then `---`, then the markdown
body. Parse the title from the `TITLE:` line and the body from everything after `---`.
Write the parsed body to `$RUN_DIR/pr-body.md` and store the title.

**Reject inline** if the draft body contains an "Affected files"/"Files changed"/"Changes"
section or a `+/-` stat block — if so, re-dispatch the writer once with an explicit note
to remove it, then continue.

## Phase 2 — REVIEW (codex)

Unless `--no-codex`, dispatch a codex reviewer to validate the draft. Assemble
`$RUN_DIR/review-input.md`:
- The drafted title + body
- The output of `git diff --name-only main...HEAD` (the reviewer needs the real
  changed-path domains to judge the Mermaid diagram)
- The detected ticket (or "none")
- The explicit checklist below

Dispatch (mirror the codex side of `executable_reviewer.sh`):

```bash
codex exec \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --color never \
  --output-last-message "$RUN_DIR/review.md" \
  - < "$RUN_DIR/review-input.md" >&2
```

The reviewer validates, returning concrete fixes:
- **Title is Conventional Commit?** valid `type`, optional scope, ≤ 70 chars.
- **Mermaid present and consistent** with the domains in `git diff --name-only main...HEAD`? (no phantom components, no missing major area)
- **NO file list / no counts** anywhere in the body?
- **Ticket present** (linked or an explicit `_no ticket_`)?
- **Slack threads present** (linked when supplied, or explicit `_none found_`)?
- **Requirements matrix complete** and statuses supported by diff/test evidence?
- **Key decisions preserved** from plan/ticket context?
- Body is objective about *what we solve* (not a changelog of the diff)?

Read `$RUN_DIR/review.md` and **apply every concrete fix** to the title / `pr-body.md`.
If the reviewer flags the file-list or ticket rules, those are blocking — re-run Phase 1
targeting the specific fix, then re-review once. Cap: 2 review iterations.

If `--dry-run`: print the final title + body and **stop here**. Do not open/update.

## Phase 3 — OPEN / UPDATE PR

Mirror the opener logic in
`/Users/barsotti/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_claude/skills/deep-plan/scripts/executable_pr-open.sh`
(read it): conventional-type inference from recent commits + changed paths, ticket
auto-detect, and CODEOWNERS reviewer detection. Reuse those, but the **title + body come
from Phases 1-2** — do not regenerate them from a template.

1. Ensure the title already carries a conventional-commit type. If somehow it doesn't,
   infer the type from recent commits / changed paths (as pr-open.sh does) and prefix it.
2. Compute `--reviewer` flags from `.github/CODEOWNERS` (or `CODEOWNERS`) matching the
   changed paths, exactly as pr-open.sh does.
3. Derive the label from the conventional-commit type (`--label <type>`).
4. The body is already at `$RUN_DIR/pr-body.md` — pass it with `--body-file` (HEREDOC not
   needed; the file already exists).

**Create** (no `--update`):

```bash
gh pr create \
  [--draft] \
  --title "$TITLE" \
  --body-file "$RUN_DIR/pr-body.md" \
  --assignee @me \
  --label "$PR_TYPE" \
  [--reviewer <owner> ...]
```

Retry without `--label`/`--reviewer` if `gh` errors (remote may lack them), same as pr-open.sh.

**Update** (`--update <n>`):

```bash
gh pr edit <n> \
  --title "$TITLE" \
  --body-file "$RUN_DIR/pr-body.md" \
  --add-assignee @me
```

## Phase 4 — Report

Print the PR URL and a one-line summary, e.g.:
`opened PR #1421 — feat(webhooks): prevent duplicate delivery — assigned to @me, ticket FBIT-2982`.

## Checklist (orchestrator ticks after Phase 3)

Verify each and report the state to the user:

- [ ] `title-conventional` — title matches `^(feat|fix|refactor|perf|docs|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .+`, ≤ 70 chars
- [ ] `mermaid-present` — body has a ```mermaid block, consistent with the changed domains
- [ ] `no-file-list` — no "Affected files"/"Files changed" section, no path inventory, no `+/-` counts
- [ ] `ticket-linked-or-n/a` — ticket linked, or an explicit `_no ticket_` when none exists
- [ ] `slack-linked-or-n/a` — relevant threads linked, or explicit `_none found_`
- [ ] `requirements-reconciled` — every requirement maps to implementation evidence and status
- [ ] `key-decisions-present` — important decisions and trade-offs are preserved
- [ ] `assigned-to-me` — PR assignee includes `@me`
- [ ] `codex-review-applied` — codex reviewer ran and its fixes were applied (or `--no-codex` was set)

If any box other than `codex-review-applied` (when `--no-codex`) is unchecked, loop back to
the relevant phase before declaring done.

## Reuse

- Headless `claude -p` / `codex exec` flag patterns: `~/.claude/skills/deep-review/scripts/executable_reviewer.sh`.
- Conventional-type inference, ticket auto-detect, CODEOWNERS reviewers: `~/.claude/skills/deep-plan/scripts/executable_pr-open.sh`.
- This skill is a runtime dependency of `deep-plan` (Phase 6 handoff) and `jira-workflow` (PR step).

## Failure modes

- Writer times out → re-dispatch once; if it fails again, surface the raw diff summary and ask the user to draft the "What this solves" paragraph.
- Codex unavailable → fall back to a Sonnet self-review (headless `claude -p --model sonnet`) applying the same checklist; note the substitution.
- `gh` not authenticated → halt at Phase 3, ask the user to `gh auth login`.
- Empty diff vs base → print "nothing to describe" and stop.
