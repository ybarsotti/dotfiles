# Local Environment Variables
#
# This file is for machine-specific environment variables that should not be
# committed to version control (API keys, tokens, local credentials, etc.)
#
# This file is sourced at the beginning of .zshrc, before any other configuration.
#
# Examples:
# export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
# export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
# export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token-here"
# export AWS_PROFILE="your-profile"
